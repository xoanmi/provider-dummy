# Provider-Dummy

Provider-Dummy is an example project showcasing how to build a Crossplane provider. It serves as a guide for developers who want to understand the process of creating a provider for Crossplane, an open-source Kubernetes add-on that allows you to define and manage cloud infrastructure using Kubernetes-style APIs.

This project is bootstrapped using the [provider-template](https://github.com/crossplane/provider-template) repository from GitHub and utilizes the [jsonplaceholder.dummy.com](https://jsonplaceholder.dummy.com) as an API example.
